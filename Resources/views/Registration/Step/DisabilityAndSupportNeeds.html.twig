        We invite disclosure from anyone who feels they may have a disability or other condition which is likely to

        <p>Madingley Hall is a Grade 1 listed building with a limited number of ground floor teaching rooms. When it is
            known that students with reduced mobility are attending courses every effort is made to ensure ground floor
            teaching rooms are used. Should this not prove possible students will be notified in advance.
